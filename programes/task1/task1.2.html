              Designers prefer to just put dummy content before the final version is ready 
              to make sure you have the right font size, color, line height, font-family, etc.</p>
       <br>
              <p>While building out a new website you may have literally no idea of 
            where to start from. Platforms like WordPress also use dummy content 
            provide better user experience before you even make your first edit 
            on the site. It makes it
             easier for you to decide which part would 
            have the content and not. Lorem ipsum is indistinguishable from 
            web designing as long as the designer is interested in finishing 
            off the project faster. </p>
